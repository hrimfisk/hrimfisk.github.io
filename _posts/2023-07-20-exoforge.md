<h3>My work:</h3>
* Implemented:
  - Various bug fixes to existing systems from a marketplace asset pack, including merging blueprints
  - Credits system:
    * Players convert resources into credits
    * Players spend credits on things such as crafting and customization colors
  - Vehicle customization system
  - Cargo system for transferring items between worlds
  - Mod system to allow players to augment their character by equipping mods
  - Melee mechanic to reduce incoming damage when blocking
  - Temperature system for designers to add hot or cold areas
    - If the player is too hot or cold, they will start losing health in increments
  - Player input remapping system
  - Stats for players to keep track of their kills

* Improved:
  - Crafting systems; vehicles, weapons, armor
  - Travel system to allow players to easily move between worlds
  - Debug menu by adding features such as resetting saved spawn location
  - Health and Steam icon display over players
  - Crouch and Swim:
    - Cannot uncrouch under a surface
    - Can now mantle an object at the surface of water
  - Character customization with additional color palettes and character species options
  - Buff system to include temperature and oxygen buffs
  - Resource and mining system:
    - Mining a resources increases your level with that resource
    - Equipment you craft with a refined resource may require a specific level of that resource to use
    - Prevented raw resources from being transferred from a world to the lobby
