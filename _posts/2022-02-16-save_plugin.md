I created a code plugin to streamline the saving and loading process in Unreal Engine 4 & 5:
* Nodes design for simplicity with less complexity in each node, giving devs more power
* SaveGameEvents interface for Pre-Save, Pre-Load, Post-Save, Post-Load, and New Save Created
* Project Settings entry allows you to customize how the plugin works, such as single or multi file saving
* 80 blueprint nodes built entirely in C++
