<h3>My Work:</h3>
* Created a power system from scratch for buildings to generate, broadcast, store, or consume power
* Buildings are connected with wires through input and output plugs attached to each building
* Buildings can be toggled on or off, and must be powered on to generate, receive, or consume power
* Each building can have a number of input and/or output plugs
* Assisted with debugging, problem solving, blueprint architecture, refactoring, and 3D math
* Heavily iterated on my <a href="https://hrimfisk.github.io/experience/2024/05/05/save-plugin/">Save Game Library Plugin</a> based on the needs of the project and developers

<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
* Players start by constructing buildings that provide power, housing, food, or extract resources
* Providing power to Needs-based buildings that are turned on add progress to objectives
* The player wins when Bounty Hunters all objectives are completed, and may continue or end the game
