    Hello! My name is Thomas Jensen, and I'm passionate about playing and creating video games. I have been playing video games since I could hold an NES controller, and I take pride in bringing ideas to life. 
    <br>
    <br>
    So far, I have enjoyed working on gameplay, PCG, AI, UI, and developer tools, and I'm eager to find out what else. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I enjoy playing a variety of games, such as Anno 1800, Baldur's Gate 3, Cities: Skylines, Diablo 2, Dark Souls, Dungeon Defenders, Fallout, Heroes of the Storm, Killing Floor, Left 4 Dead, Mordhau, Payday, Rust, The Elder Scrolls, World of Warcraft, Valheim, and more.
