<h3>AI:</h3>
* Bounty Hunters driven by AI using Utility Theory and Behavior Trees
* Hunters have a list of needs that must be satisfied by collecting items from shops
* If the last shop a Hunter needs is not available, that Hunter will wander until the shop is available or the Hunter becomes frustrated and goes to battle, getting themselves killed
* When a Hunter's needs are satisfied, that Hunter goes to battle strong enough to survive
* When a Hunter is finished fighting, their needs are depleted and they return to town

<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
* Players provide needs by clicking on shops they have purchased to produce items
* Hunters spawn every 20 second and go to available shops to collect items based on needs
* Hunters start by needing rest, then an additional need unlocks every 30 seconds until all available needs are required; Rest, Water, Food, Gloves, Armor, Sword
* The player wins when Bounty Hunters all enemies, and loses if 5 Bounty Hunters die
